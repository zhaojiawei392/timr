## DualQuaternion-based robot control

#### This project is the implementation of dual quaternion based robot control platform. TIMR stands for This is my robot. this project intend to provide a simple, light-weight, cross-platform kinematics simulation library for robot arm. About dual quaternion, please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_quaternion. This project is solely intended for personal practice and experimentation.
